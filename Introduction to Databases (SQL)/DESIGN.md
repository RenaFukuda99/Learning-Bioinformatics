# Design Document

By Rena Fukuda


## Scope

This database organizes the food descriptions in the book series
"A Song of Ice and Fire" by George R.R. Martin, ranked by Youtubers 'Glidus' and 
'AltSchwiftX'. The database includes the  reviewers, the passages (food descriptions)
they have read, as well as the ratings they have given each passage. Additionally,
the database contains information regarding the POV character in each passage, 
as well as the book in which each passage is found.

This database does not take into account non-POV characters that may be present.
